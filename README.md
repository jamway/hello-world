# hello-world
jamway's first repository at Github. Built for testing funiitons and experiments

Like many others, I am just starting learning how to use Github, mainly for my data science track.
Having a bit of statistic base, knowing the basic of programming, and possessing few years of experience, I am looking forward to learn more about machine learning.

Adding commit comment.
